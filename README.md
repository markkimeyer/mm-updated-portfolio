## Markki Meyer- Updated Portfolio

The portfolio from week 2 has been updated with several new features. Most changes were made to the Contact and Gallery pages.

### Gallery

The Gallery page now features three examples of my work including Project One and two homework assignments. Hover over the images of the projects and notice how they reduce in opacity. Click and the live page will open in a new tab. Read the brief description and then click on the Repository button to be taken to the specific github repository for the apps. Another css hover feature has been added to bold the font of the buttons.

### Contact

The contact page has many new improvements. Instead of a form that previously lead nowhere, there are now 4 fully functional buttons.
